# Error Handling Guidelines

## DeepWiki First Approach

When encountering errors, technical issues, or unexpected behavior:

1. **Always use DeepWiki first** - Do not rely on your own knowledge to solve technical problems
2. **Query the relevant repository** - Ask specific questions about the error or issue to the appropriate GitHub repository via DeepWiki
3. **Include context** - Provide the actual error message, code snippet, and relevant details in your DeepWiki query
4. **Apply the solution** - Only after getting accurate information from DeepWiki, implement the recommended fix

## Examples of When to Use DeepWiki

- Package/library API changes or deprecations
- Unexpected error messages
- Configuration issues
- Framework-specific problems
- Type errors or compilation issues
- Runtime errors

## Query Format

Structure DeepWiki queries like:
```
I'm encountering [specific error/issue] with [technology/package]. 
Here's my code: [code snippet]
Error message: [exact error]
What could be causing this and how should I fix it?
```

This ensures accurate, up-to-date solutions rather than potentially outdated knowledge.
